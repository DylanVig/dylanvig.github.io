        description: 'This is my tour guide optimizer, and my first larger scale project with a more complicated tech stack. When people travel to foreign countries, they often struggle planning their trip, deciding what tourist sites to travel to and when. This web application helps suggest tourist sites based on the city you travel to and optimizes the route to those sites. I also used algorithms such as backtracking and the Held-Karp algorithm to develop these optimized routes!',

        description: 'This was the culmination of all of my researching and testing during my internship at Mage Data. I was tasked with enhancing the data discovery model by increasing the accuracy of its data categorizations. To do this, I looked into various machine learning and common regex libraries, eventually settling on the Capital One library. Overall, this experience was fantastic and it taught me how to use third-party libraries while also introducing me to Machine Learning and Cybersecurity.',

Ever since I started coding, it was always my goal to recreate this game, and I was finally able to accomplish this goal. I used Java for both the front end and the back end, utilizing the Swing library and the Abstract Window Toolkit. When creating my project, the main logic I used to create the snake was a reversed Linked List to create the chaining effect. Overall, this was a fun project to work on and a very fulfilling experience. Here is my project link: ',

After creating Snake, I wanted to create another personal project to help solidify some of the concepts that I learned in Object-Oriented Programming, such as concurrency, polymorphism, GUIs, etc. Similarly to Snake, I used Java with the Swing library and the Abstract Window Toolkit. This game is slightly incomplete, as I havenâ€™t added music or cooler graphics, but I got a very baseline project finished. Overall, I learned a lot from creating this project and enjoyed this!
